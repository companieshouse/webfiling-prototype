    Trading shares on a market makes a company a 'traded company'. This means that during the confirmation period, the company had shares admitted to one or more of the following:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a market established under the rules of a UK recognised investment exchange</li>
      <li>any other regulated market in or outside of the UK</li>
      <li>any other market outside of the UK</li>
    </ul>
  </p> The term ‘traded company’ should not be confused with ‘trading company’, which means a company that is not dormant).
